# Compilebench (Version 0.6)Compilebench tries to age a filesystem by simulating some of the disk IO common in creating, compiling, patching, stating and reading kernel trees. It indirectly measures how well filesystems can maintain directory locality as the disk fills up and directories age.#### Docker Image[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/ljishen/compilebench.svg)](http://microbadger.com/images/ljishen/compilebench "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")#### Usage```bashdocker run --rm -t ljishen/compilebench``````Options:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -b BUFFER_SIZE, --buffer-size=BUFFER_SIZE                        buffer size (bytes)  -i INITIAL_DIRS, --initial-dirs=INITIAL_DIRS                        number of dirs initially created  -r RUNS, --runs=RUNS  number of rand op runs  -D DIRECTORY, --directory=DIRECTORY                        working directory  -s SOURCES, --sources=SOURCES                        data set source file directory  -t TRACE, --trace=TRACE                        blktrace output file  -d DEVICE, --device=DEVICE                        blktrace device  -m, --makej           simulate a make -j on the initial dirs and exit  -n, --no-sync         don't sync and drop caches between each iteration```The default execution performs real time scheduling benchmarks and uses cpu load of 1 with burn load.See [Home Page](https://oss.oracle.com/~mason/compilebench/) of Compilebench for more details.

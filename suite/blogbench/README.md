# Blogbench - A filesystem benchmark for Unix (Version 1.1)Blogbench is a portable filesystem benchmark that tries to reproduce the load of a real-world busy file server.It stresses the filesystem with multiple threads performing random reads, writes and rewrites in order to get a realistic idea of the scalability and the concurrency a system can handle.#### Docker Image[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/ljishen/blogbench.svg)](http://microbadger.com/images/ljishen/blogbench "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")#### Sample Usage```bashdocker run --rm \    -v `pwd`:/root/results \    ljishen/blogbench \    /tmp /root/results/output.prof```###### Available options```--commenters=<n> (-c <n>): number of comments posters--help (-h): usage--iterations=<n> (-i <n>): number of iterations--readers=<n> (-r <n>): number of writers--rewriters=<n> (-W <n>): number of rewriters--sleep=<secs> (-s <secs>): delay after every iteration--writers=<n> (-w <n>): number of writers```By default, there are 3 concurrent writers, 1 rewriters, 5 commenters and 100 readers, and it will run for 30 iterations.See [Homepage](https://www.pureftpd.org/project/blogbench) of Blogbench for more details.

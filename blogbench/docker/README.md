# Blogbench - A filesystem benchmark for UnixBlogbench is a portable filesystem benchmark that tries to reproduce the load of a real-world busy file server.It stresses the filesystem with multiple threads performing random reads, writes and rewrites in order to get a realistic idea of the scalability and the concurrency a system can handle.#### Sample Usage```bashdocker run --rm -t ljishen/blogbench```By default, there are 3 concurrent writers, 1 rewriters, 100 readers and 5 commenters.See [Home Page](https://www.pureftpd.org/project/blogbench) of Blogbench for more details.

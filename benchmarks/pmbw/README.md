# pmbw - Parallel Memory Bandwidth Benchmark / Measurement (Version 4a3b377)The tool pmbw is a set of assembler routines to measure the parallel memory (cache and RAM) bandwidth of modern multi-core machines.#### Docker Image[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/ljishen/pmbw.svg)](http://microbadger.com/images/ljishen/pmbw "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")#### Sample Usage```bash# Run pmbw.# All statistical output of pmbw is written to the file /root/results/stats.profdocker run --rm \    -v `pwd`:/root/results \    ljishen/pmbw \    pmbw /root/results/stats.prof -S 0# The stats2gnuplot program can create a PDF from the statistical file via gnuplot.# File stats.txt should be in the same directory as the output file (`pwd` in the following example).# The output PDF is called plots-<host>.pdf.docker run --rm \    -v `pwd`:/root/results \    ljishen/pmbw \    stats2gnuplot /root/results/stats.prof```##### Available Options for pmbw```-f <match>     Run only benchmarks containing this substring, can be used multile times. Try "list".-M <size>      Limit the maximum amount of memory allocated at startup [byte].-o <file>      Write the results to <file> instead of stats.txt.-p <nthrs>     Run benchmarks with at least this thread count.-P <nthrs>     Run benchmarks with at most this thread count (overrides detected processor count).-Q             Run benchmarks with quadratically increasing thread count.-s <size>      Limit the _minimum_ test array size [byte]. Set to 0 for no limit.-S <size>      Limit the _maximum_ test array size [byte]. Set to 0 for no limit.```See [Homepage](https://panthema.net/2013/pmbw/) and [Git repository](https://github.com/bingmann/pmbw) of pmbw for more details.
